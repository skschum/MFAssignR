Package Updates

10/25/2018
- POEx option is now working
- NOEx (negative odd electron assignment) has now been implemented
- Fluorine assignment now implemented (Flx)

01/18/2019
- See documentation for more in depth description of the changes
- Addition of more versions of MFAssign functions (MFAssignAll_MSMS, MFAssign_RMD, MFAssignCHO_RMD)
- Added new noise estimation function "KMDNoise" and renamed original to "HistNoise"
- Included 34S and 2 13C as potential isotopic masses in IsoFiltR
- Improved mass recalibration by adding a segmented "walking" component
- Changed name of MFRecalcheck to "Recal"
- Changed name of MFRecalList to "RecalList"
- Added second mass recalibration function "Recal_2", which is slightly different than "Recal"
- Generally enhanced performance and speed of the functions in the package
- Improved molecular formula assignment by decreasing incorrect sulfur assignments

05/13/2019
- Made the sulfur isotope check optional via the "SulfCheck" parameter
- Removed MFAssignAll() and MFAssignAll_MSMS() 
- Added the functionality of those functions to MFAssign and MFAssignCHO() with the parameters "Ambig" and "MSMS" respectively
- Added RecalX() and Recal_2X() as additional recalibration functions. See documentation for more information
- General improvements to flexibility and transparency of moleular formula assignment.

10/10/2019
- Combined all four versions of Recal() into a single function. All functionality is still available, but is accessed via the "opt" parameter in the function. opt = 1 replaces RecalX(), opt = 2 replaces Recal_2X(), opt = 3 replaces Recal(), and opt = 4 replaces Recal_2().
- Additional controls were added to IsoFiltR() so now the user can set the matching error allowance for mono/iso pairs using the "Carberr" or "Sulferr" parameters. The maximum allowed 34S ratio can also be set by the user now using the "Sulfrat" parameter.
- Internal change to MFAssign() and MFAssignCHO() now check the O/C and H/C ratios during formula extension, if they exceed the limits set by the user, the formula is discarded. This was done post formula extension in previous versions. 

Version 1.0.0
Please see the ReadMe for more information about changes to the code.
- Improvements to formula extension methodology for improved formula assignment
- Reworked and simplified recalibration in the Recal() function
- Increased user control of "slice" in KMDNoise()
- Improved isotope identification and assignment through changes in IsoFilter() and MFAssign()/MFAssignCHO()
- Made the N3OS to 13C correction in MFAssign() optional
