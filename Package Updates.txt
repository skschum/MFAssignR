Package Updates

10/25/2018
- POEx option is now working
- NOEx (negative odd electron assignment) has now been implemented
- Fluorine assignment now implemented (Flx)

01/18/2019
- See documentation for more in depth description of the changes
- Addition of more versions of MFAssign functions (MFAssignAll_MSMS, MFAssign_RMD, MFAssignCHO_RMD)
- Added new noise estimation function "KMDNoise" and renamed original to "HistNoise"
- Included 34S and 2 13C as potential isotopic masses in IsoFiltR
- Improved mass recalibration by adding a segmented "walking" component
- Changed name of MFRecalcheck to "Recal"
- Changed name of MFRecalList to "RecalList"
- Added second mass recalibration function "Recal_2", which is slightly different than "Recal"
- Generally enhanced performance and speed of the functions in the package
- Improved molecular formula assignment by decreasing incorrect sulfur assignments

05/13/2019
- Made the sulfur isotope check optional via the "SulfCheck" parameter
- Removed MFAssignAll() and MFAssignAll_MSMS() 
- Added the functionality of those functions to MFAssign and MFAssignCHO() with the parameters "Ambig" and "MSMS" respectively
- Added RecalX() and Recal_2X() as additional recalibration functions. See documentation for more information
- General improvements to flexibility and transparency of moleular formula assignment.
